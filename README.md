# Movie Recommendation System - Task 2

## Overview
This project involves designing screens for a movie recommendation system using Figma. The goal is to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface that allows users to discover and watch their favorite movies.

## Objective
The primary objective is to design a user-friendly interface for a movie recommendation system. This includes creating screens for the home page, movie details, and splash screen. The design should enhance user experience and make it easy for users to find and watch movies.

## Tools
- **Figma**: For designing the screens and prototyping the user interface.
- **GitHub**: For version control and hosting the project repository.

## Design Process
1. **Research**: Understand the requirements and gather inspiration from existing movie recommendation systems.
2. **Wireframing**: Create basic wireframes to outline the structure and layout of the screens.
3. **Design**: Develop high-fidelity designs in Figma, focusing on aesthetics and usability.
4. **Prototyping**: Create interactive prototypes to simulate user interactions.
5. **Feedback**: Gather feedback from peers and mentors to refine the designs.
6. **Finalization**: Make necessary adjustments and finalize the screens.

## Outcome
The outcome is a set of well-designed screens for a movie recommendation system, including:
- **Home Screen**: Displays popular movies and a search bar.
- **Movie Details Screen**: Provides detailed information about a selected movie, including ratings, reviews, and a synopsis.
- **Splash Screen**: The initial screen that appears when the app is launched, featuring the app logo and a "Get Started" button.
